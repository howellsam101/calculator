# calculator
This is one of my first python files.
This command line calulator is small project i have been working on. I am always working
to improve the functionality and add new features. I have been working on adding some modes
for calculas, as well as improving the interface to make it easier to use. the matrix edit 
just has a cool matrix effect (credit you Corey Goldberg on youtube). 

The code is quite straightforward, just run it in the terminal or IDE.
